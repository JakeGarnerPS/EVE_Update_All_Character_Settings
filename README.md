Overview
This script streamlines the process of updating all your characters' settings by aligning them with your main (selected) character's configurations. It's a quick solution for efficiently applying uniform settings across multiple characters, char, and user files.

Instructions
Follow these steps to ensure the proper functioning of the script:

Download: Obtain the main.dist folder, which contains the executable (.exe) file.
Important: Create a backup of the file or folder you intend to modify.

Backup Existing Files:

Navigate to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\c_ccp_eve_online_tq_tranquility.
Create a copy of the folder you wish to modify, normally this is settings_Default.
Launch EVE Client:

Open the Eve client.
Log in with the character whose settings you want to replicate.
After logging in, close the game.
Access Settings Folder:

Open the copied settings folder.
Identify the two most recent files: core_char and core_user. These represent your character IDs.
Note down both numbers, distinguishing between the user and character IDs, and also record the folder path.
Run the Script:

Execute the .exe file.
It will prompt you for the folder path; paste it in and press 'Enter'.
Provide the Character ID (from core_char file) when prompted and press 'Enter'.
Provide the User ID (from core_user file), paste the number, and press 'Enter'.
Confirmation:

The process is complete, and your accounts should be updated.
Verify by either logging in and checking or examining the Date Modified time (it should reflect the time you ran the .exe).
